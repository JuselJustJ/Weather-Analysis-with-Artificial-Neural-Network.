# Weather-Analysis-with-Artificial-Neural-Network.
Weather analysis has become one of the most interesting fields to research in modern times. Most of the time researchers tried to make a linear connection between the input data of weather and equivalent objective data. But in the later part after introducing the non-linear characteristics of weather data, the aim has focused on the analysis and forecasting of weather. However, the Artificial Neural Network has developed into a superior method to highlight the structural relationship between the various elements as weather data is nonlinear and monitors an identical unbalanced development. This study analyzes the application of ANN software by evaluating efficient and authentic nonlinear models to analyze the weather. Additionally, relate and assess how well the generated models performed in analyzing the highest temperature for 2009 to July 2020 using various transfer methods, concealed layers, and neurons.
